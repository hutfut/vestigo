# Netflix Culture Memo

At Netflix, we aspire to entertain the world, thrilling audiences everywhere. To do that, we've developed an unusual company culture focused on excellence, and creating an environment where talented people can thrive — lifting ourselves, each other and our audiences higher and higher. This culture is based on four core principles:

1. **The Dream Team** — We aim only to have high performers: people who are great at what they do, and even better at working together.
2. **People Over Process** — Better outcomes come when employees have the information and freedom to make decisions for themselves. We hire unusually responsible people who thrive on openness and freedom.
3. **Uncomfortably Exciting** — To entertain the world, we need to be bold and ambitious, embracing the thrill of what's next — even when it's uncomfortable.
4. **Great and Always Better** — Netflix sucks today compared to where we can be tomorrow. We need the self-awareness to understand what should be better, and the discipline and resilience to get there.

## The Dream Team

We model ourselves on a professional sports team, not a family. Families are about unconditional love — and can be dysfunctional. Professional sports teams focus on performance and picking the right person for every position, even when that means swapping out someone they love for a better player.

### Values We Value

- **Selflessness** — Humble when searching for the best ideas; seek what's best for Netflix, not yourself or your team; take time to help others succeed.
- **Judgment** — Look beyond short-term fixes in favor of long-term solutions; make wise decisions despite ambiguity; use data to inform intuition.
- **Candor** — Willingly receive and give feedback; open about what's working and what needs to improve; admit mistakes openly and share learnings widely.
- **Creativity** — Welcome new ideas; passionate and persistent in pursuit of innovative solutions; value artistic expression.
- **Courage** — Vulnerable in search for the truth; willing to risk failure or challenge the status quo in pursuit of excellence.
- **Inclusion** — Recognize biases and work to counteract them; ensure everyone at Netflix can do their best work, whatever their culture, identity or background.
- **Curiosity** — Learn rapidly and eagerly; interested in other people's ideas as much as your own; humble about what you don't yet know.
- **Resilience** — Quickly adapt to changing circumstances; make tough decisions without agonizing; embrace a hard challenge.

### Extraordinary Candor

We invest in strong professional relationships built on trust and good intent. This enables extraordinary candor — constructive feedback as part of everyday work. It takes courage and vulnerability to ask how you could do better, to seek alternative opinions, and integrity to only say things about a colleague you're willing to share with them directly.

### Performance Culture

A high performer in any role is many times more effective than the average employee. We pay personal top of market for the role and location. Leaders apply the **keeper test**: "If X wanted to leave, would I fight to keep them?" or "Knowing everything I know today, would I hire X again?" If the answer is no, we part ways quickly.

Managers evaluate team members on their whole record, not just mistakes or bets that didn't pay off. We stick with employees through short-term bumps. There is no place on the Dream Team for people who don't treat their colleagues with decency and respect.

## People Over Process

We aim to inspire and empower more than manage. We pride ourselves on how few, not how many, decisions senior leaders make.

### Context Not Control

Managers give teams the context and clarity needed to make good decisions instead of trying to control everything. This is not hands-off management — managers need to be involved, actively coach their teams, and may step in when someone is about to make an unethical decision, one that could materially harm Netflix, during a crisis, or when a new team member lacks full context.

### Informed Captain

For every significant decision, we identify an **informed captain** responsible for making the judgment call. Teams then implement the decision independently. This **highly aligned, loosely coupled** approach gives teams the freedom to move quickly while ensuring accountability.

Informed captains **farm for dissent** — seeking out different opinions and listening to people at every level. After a decision is made, everyone is expected to **disagree then commit**, and afterwards reflect on what worked and what didn't.

### Minimal Rules

We keep rules to a minimum and ensure any process is simple, efficient, and impactful. Our vacation policy: "Take vacation." Our expenses policy: "Act in Netflix's best interests." Strict rules exist only where they must — harassment, marginalizing colleagues, leaking company information, insider trading. We minimize rules and processes rather than errors, giving people freedom to use their own judgment and learn from their mistakes.

## Uncomfortably Exciting

Netflix programs for well over half a billion people globally. Success requires bold, ambitious thinking — experimentation and rapid adaptation across product features, recommendations, marketing, and content. Many people will be happier at more stable companies. Netflix works best for those who value experimentation, enjoy the uncomfortable excitement of new challenges, and have the resilience to thrive in this environment.

### Artistic Expression

Our members come from many backgrounds and cultures and want to see a wide variety of stories on screen. We support the artistic expression of the creators we choose to work with, program for diverse audiences and tastes, and provide ratings, content advisories, and parental controls to help members choose. Employees support these principles even if some stories run counter to personal values.

## Great and Always Better

We constantly seek to improve our culture, not preserve it. Every new employee helps shape how we work — finding new ways to accomplish more together. This creates a better experience for members, employees, creators and partners, which propels long-term growth and success.
